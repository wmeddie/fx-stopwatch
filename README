Stopwatch

A stopwatch app made with Scala and JavaFX.

Making a stopwatch is kind of a [code kata](1) I've been wanting to do to
compare and contrast a few different platforms.  JavaFX is the first one but
I'll also make implementations of pretty much the same program in Qt and WPF.

The choice of using Scala was to make things a bit more challenging.
